JOINING DATA W PANDAS or MERGING TABLES, same terms


MERGE method 
col to merge on?
c'e two diff datasets, merge on an index-like col taht is common to both

mergedFrame = old1.merge(old2, on="indexCol")

- First table's columns will show first mergedFrame, then 2nd
- The rows in mergedTable have matching values for the chosen column in both tables.
- Column names are still unique, any matching are now col_x and col_y, specifying their source
- to change how matching cols get suffixed : 
    newMerged = table1.merge(table2, on='indexCol', suffixes=('_first', '_next'))

- .value_counts gets the most-populated columns methinks
- .shape gets number of rows

ONE TO MANY relshps
one to one = e/ row in L table =~ ONLY one row in R
one to many= e/ row in L table =~ MORE THAN ONE row in R

t.ex - City table, Business table. each city has lots busns, lets claim a busns can only be in one City

MERGING MULTIPLE TABLES
First two tables
merge on COMBO of data, a LIST, to keep values unique & not erroneous

mergedTable = grants.merge(liceneses, on = ['address','zip'])
    result will just have first TWO columns be those list pairs.

Now for a third table, here we have a 'ward' col name and add suffixes
